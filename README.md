# Luciana-Sosa

"ScrabbleGame is a game where 2 to 4 people can play. Each player takes turns placing words on the board, starting from the center. All words must be connected. Each player has a Rack, which is their bag of letters. With these letters, they must create words. Each letter tile has different values, which are used to determine the winner at the end. The game ends when there are no more letters left for the players. (The words are from the Spanish dictionary and will be validated by the game.) "
